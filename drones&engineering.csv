Friendly reminder: go to local industry conferences,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/sizgg3/friendly_reminder_go_to_local_industry_conferences/,These can be better than career fairs where HR drones are just trying to pump up *their* numbers for their upcoming semi-annual performance review.  For example the IEEE annual conference on semiconductor widgets is in town. Skip the talks and go to the vendor hall. Chat up representatives from companies you’re interested in. Demonstrate full knowledge of the industry and the fact that you’re able to hold a conversation. Mention that you’re looking for a full time internship/first real big girl job in the near future and maybe they can get someone in HR in touch with you?  I’ve done this and it has led to job offers.   You can potentially get in free if you’re a student member of the relevant organization or if you know a prof involved in the planning committee.  Obviously these should not be happening right now because of something called Covid-19 but after that little birdy flies the coop then events will start up again.,Thanks u/BlockchainMeYourTits.,Pogchamp username Also thanks for the advice ig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Does your university offer an innovations degree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/xzxbws/does_your_university_offer_an_innovations_degree/,My school offers a degree called Bachelor of Innovation. Do any other schools have this? For context I'm a Mechanical engineering student that ended up taking a couple classes for the program because they applied to some general education requirements.  This entire degree seems like a scam. To start I don't think innovation is a teachable skill I don't think we have figured out the secrets to innovation to the point you can teach it to other people. Additionally the classes do not include any engineering curriculum. In the classes I took it was closer to a philosophy class and focused on how to think and approach problems which sounds good but it wasn't. Ultimately the class teaches you to disregard current solutions and try to start from scratch and no idea is to far out there or impossible. The result is students coming up with ideas like nuclear powered firefighting drones and a robot therapist that lives with you. (These were actual ideas pursued by students...). I almost felt bad for those enrolled in the program as I don't see any company looking for someone that pitched wild ideas for 4 years and has no experience in how to bring any of those ideas to fruition. I also think innovation for the sake of innovation is pointless and the merit of an idea should be its usefulness not how new it is.  &#x200B;  This kind of turned into a rant but does anyone go to a college with this degree? Do you know any students who got a job with it? Is there really any value in having this as a 4 year degree?,We got a degree in entrepreneurship.  Likely the closest it will get for most schools.,"It wouldn't happen to be connected to Stanford's d.school would it? Feels like you're describing something similar to my experience with a ""Design Thinking"" class.",All nope.,dont take it especially if the employers has no clue what it is,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

side project lust,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/u94wkx/side_project_lust/,"All throughout undergrad I had a habit of wanting to start some side project and then getting carried away with far-fetched ideas that wouldnt go anywhere in a ""hobby"" or ""side-project"" since and never actually got anywhere with anything. Once I graduated and have a job that I love that urge sort of went away for some time but now I find myself still wanting to do stuff outside of work and I have the same problem.   Does anyone else get stuck like this? I'm past the Arduino and Rpi ""tinkerer"" thing and want to really do some meaningful design work but on a ""spare time"" scale but every time I think of something it's either way too complicated or I kid myself that I'll compete in the consumer space somehow.  I dont care about profiting but I like the idea of making something genuinely useful or novel and especially something that slots into an open source ecosystem. I used to work with drones and loved being a part of the PX4 and Ardupilot communities for example.   Just thought I'd put this out there in case anyone else relates or had thoughts",I guess I would first look for something that would make your life easier or more convenient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mechatronics Vs Robotics which one should I choose?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/wk2gtx/mechatronics_vs_robotics_which_one_should_i_choose/,I am struggling with what to choose between Mechatronics and Robotics. I don't know a lot about any of these fields. So will you help me to choose?  I have a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in Computer Science.  I was always fascinated by Autonomous Vehicles Artificial Intelligence Robots Delivery Drones Computers Machine Learning Vending Machines ATMs and how analog signals turn into digital etc.  What should I study to have a good understanding of the subjects mentioned above?   &#x200B;  Can you also please tell me how Mechatronics and Robtics differ?,Hello /u/kazizilani!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/EngineeringStudents) if you have any questions or concerns.*,The reality is that the difference between the two is as big or small as the specific universities decide. Some universities are more famous for control systems for example so they focus on that while others might put more emphasis on the mechanics. You have to read the curriculums to find the differences because in a general sense mechatronics and robotics are often interchangeable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DJI blacklisted and labeled as a Chinese military company by the Department of Defense,https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/xyk41c/dji_blacklisted_and_labeled_as_a_chinese_military/,DJI blacklisted by the [Department of Defense](https://dronexl.co/us-government/department-of-defense/) (DoD) as the drone maker is now considered a Chinese military company.  >“Today the Department of Defense released the names of “Chinese military companies” operating directly or indirectly in the [United States](https://dronexl.co/countries/united-states/) in accordance with the statutory requirement of Section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021” the statement reads.  The Pentagon’s decision is the latest chapter in the saga of the US government versus the world’s biggest drone manufacturer and comes right before the [DJI Airworks](https://dronexl.co/drone-companies/dji/dji-airworks/) event in Las Vegas next week.  The [DoD statement](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3180636/dod-releases-list-of-peoples-republic-of-china-prc-military-companies-in-accord/) officiates what the department has been doing in practice since last year: not letting its employees buy or use DJI drones.  The announcement makes official what the DoD has been doing in practice since last year: not letting its employees buy or use DJI drones.  The DoD has banned off-the-shelf DJI drones for official work since 2018. However last year an [internal report](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer/) stated that an investigation of the two Da Jiang Innovations (DJI) drones manufactured for government usage discovered “no malicious code or intent” and are “recommended for use by government entities and forces working with US services.”  In response to the internal report making the news DJI drones were labeled “[potential threats to national security](https://dronexl.co/2021/07/23/department-of-defense-dji-drones-threats-national-security/)“ last year.  ## DJI blacklisted by Department of Defense  Now it seems that we have entered a new phase as the Department of Defense has added DJI to a list of 13 Chinese companies that are believed to have close ties to [China](https://dronexl.co/countries/china/)’s government and military.  The 13 Chinese companies were added to the [existing list of 47 other Chinese organizations](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Oct/05/2003091659/-1/-1/0/1260H%20COMPANIES.PDF).  >“The Department is determined to highlight and counter the PRC Military-Civil Fusion strategy which supports the modernization goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise are acquired and developed by PRC companies universities and research programs that appear to be civilian entities. Section 1260H directs the Department to begin identifying among other things Military-Civil Fusion contributors operating directly or indirectly in the United States.”   >   >   “The Department will continue to update the list with additional entities as appropriate.”      >   >“The United States Government reserves the right to take additional actions on these entities under authorities other than section 1260H.”  DJI immediately issued a statement in response to the actions of the Department of Defense calling the blacklisting unwarranted.  >“DJI stands alone as the only drone company to clearly denounce and actively discourage military use of our products including suspending all business operations in [Russia](https://dronexl.co/countries/russia/) and [Ukraine](https://dronexl.co/countries/ukraine/) to try to keep our drones out of the conflict there. There is no reason why DJI has been added to the Defense Department’s list of ‘Chinese military companies.’   >   >   “DJI does not fall under any categories set by the law to be included on the list. DJI is not a military company in China the United States or anywhere else. DJI has never designed or manufactured military-grade equipment and has never marketed or sold its products for military use in any country. Instead we have always developed products to benefit society and save lives.      >   >“We stand ready to formally challenge our inclusion on the list.”  [https://dronexl.co/2022/10/08/dji-blacklisted-department-of-defense/](https://dronexl.co/2022/10/08/dji-blacklisted-department-of-defense/)  https://preview.redd.it/f6w0d378mis91.jpg?width=1592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ad9c1c4e6186d84e6102dd29d0ee47cbad9a941,I mean we all already knew that. I love my DJI products but you'd have to be a either a complete fool or naive af to not know everything they gather is shared with the CCP.,So can I still fly my mini 3,Serous question what would be a affordable substitute for DJI? Preferably American or European company. Thanks in advance.,I'd like to see an American company make something competitive,Oh no. Another company is selling my data. Who could've ever predicted this. I never would've thought this would happen especially seeing as other companies like reddit Microsoft Google apple Samsung Sony Dell Facebook etc *definitely* don't do exactly the same thing. I'm just so distraught.  /s if anyone is really that dense,The good news is I’m not in the government or military.,Good,Good!!!,I remember five or six years ago I said on here I wouldn't buy a Chinese drone and everyone told me I was a racist asshole lol. Yeah I'm not a weirdo conservative but I don't want to give the Chinese government data on the American countryside.  I'm okay with non-American drones but no Chinese. If anything I want to build my own for FPV racing at this point.,Why though? What data could China possible gather from DJI that isn't either entirely useless or can easily be acquired elsewhere. They don't care about what your local park looks like or the last selfie you took. The only thing China would be interested in is military information and last time I checked flying drones of any kind over a military is base is very prohibited.,Oh well. I love my DJI mini and their customer service has been excellent. They literally had my drone shipped to repairs and fixed in one day and back to me in two days.,so how does this affect people who might potentially work for the dod who has dji,So I’m a 107 who regularly flies in NYC(Mavic 2 pro mostly). Was interviewed by FBI because while flying a Dronebase mission in lower manhattan I flew too close to 26 fed plaza. So I know that LE/IC are VERY wary of the intel gathering capabilities of “civilian” drones. That said I don’t think DJI has a massive spy operation in the USA on behalf of CCP. Overreaction by DOD.,It seems like they were pressured to sell/give to Ukraine to use against Russia and China would never allow that hence the inclusion.,This is false nonsense,Wonder what this will do to their stock,In the Guard and have multiple Dji drones. Don't use them on base tho obviously.,Can’t trust either US or China but we don’t haven much of a choice.,I use Dronelink to do a bunch of stuff. Can anyone comment on whether this solves the DJI phone home problem ?,If only we had a reason to manufacture things in a country we can trust.,It's part of having a business in China is you have to work with the ccp/Chinese military...,When dji decided to circumvent Google's appstore i was wary about data security. What can i do though ? Im an adroid user and left apple some years back. No substitute unless you live in the US where you can get products like skydio.,lol honor board,Thankfully I don't live in the US. The USA ban all good quality inexpensive products because in a free market American products can't compete. 😂 How desperate.,Look at OP’s post history - probably working for the competition to DJI,I guess no more dji lol
Help finding my deceased Father-in-Law's airplane wreckage?,https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/w2foec/help_finding_my_deceased_fatherinlaws_airplane/,Good People of /r/Drones !  I come to you with a bit of a strange request but I find myself quickly running out of options and was hoping someone might be able to help me out or point me in the right direction.  In November of 2021 my Father-in-Law passed away in what's known as a Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFiT) which means there was likely some kind of a medical event on board his single engine airplane because there was no change in altitude heading or speed at the time of impact.  The crash site is located in the San Gorgonio Mountain range in San Bernardino County Southern California off of the San Bernardino Peak Trail.  Our family is planning a hike up to the area but the precise location of the wreckage is still unknown and is in highly hazardous terrain (think slippery and jagged cliffs). It is very likely that we will need a some level of climbing and mountaineering equipment to *safely* reach the wreckage although it is only about 1/2 mile off trail.  We have ADSB data that pinged a few seconds before impact so we have a very good rough idea of where everything is located but we are hesitant to begin our hiking and climbing until I have some more accurate data I can input into my Garmin watch.  I am also still in contact with the helo pilot who was first on scene the day of and he says the wreckage is still very easily visible from the air as he has flown in the area recently (within the last ten days). For what it's worth years ago I did a ride along with LA County Sheriff's Department which included a few hours in one of their aviation units and I figured it would be worth a shot asking these guys so I requested a ride along from SBCSD and San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said no pretty quickly.  Please reach out via DM if you would like more info or maybe to get together one morning to see if we can locate the wreckage and possibly snap a few photos.   Thank you so so much for taking the time to read this. Our family is still desperately seeking some closure and thus I am here.  - Curtis,I know that trail! Have done it twice. I’m in the Pasadena area. Not sure if I could be able to join on the hike itself but I’m okay with letting you guys use my drone teaching you how to maneuver it! It’s a DJI mini 2 so it’ll have solid 4K footage/pictures nothing super fancy though. DM me and we might work it out!,I did a little digging through the Ntsb databases. Pretty sure I found the prelim accident report. Do you have a copy of that yet?  It does have the estimated latitude and longitude if that would help.   Looks like it’s a decent distance from any sort of paved roads though decently close to the SB Peak Divide trail. Coordinates on the FAA report are about 1000 feet south of the Limber Pine campground.  Closest spot to hike in lessee SB Peak trail 1w07 starts off road 1n53 which is off of frontage road in Angelus Oaks. Angelus Oaks fire station 5766 frontage road is really close to the intersection of frontage and 1n53. As the crow flies it’s approx 3 miles from the fire station to Limber pines campsite. Doing the measurement thing on goog maps it’s close to 5 on the actual trails.    On a good note it’s a national forest not a national park so drones aren’t tacitly banned.   I wish you the best of luck with this endeavor. If you don’t have the prelim report already pm me and I’ll send you the link.,Have you posted this to any FB drone groups? There are tens of thousands of members on some of them.   Good luck. I’m sorry for your loss.,Nearby also in dtla with the mavic air 2 and some fpv inav planes,Unable to help but wishing you the best of luck.,Dunno if this is useful but since ur in san bernardino maybe u could reach out to baker x derek (motorvlog youtuber) i recon if he did a video looking for the wreckage you might get enough publicity to actually help find it. Plus he also does drone stuff and seems to really like to do exploration type videos honestly i think it could work out exceptionally well.,Can’t help but good luck and sorry for your loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Software to Conduct Semiautonomous Flights for Perimeter Inspection,https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/xqgmqm/software_to_conduct_semiautonomous_flights_for/,For background I'm a field engineer in the utility scale solar construction industry. We develope some very large sites and a substantial amount of our focus is on storm water pollution prevention. We set up a lot of erosion controls around the perimeters of these sites and they need constant inspections.  We are currently using a DJI Mavic Pro 2 and Drone Deploy. It's great for capturing progress of open areas and gathering approximate survey data but it's terrible for inspecting perimeters that are often obscured from above by the edge of the tree canopys  What I'm looking for is a software that will have the drone fly a predetermined path preferably created from a kml or similar file type while being able to video control the yaw of the drone and control the camera gimbal.  I will warn you that the rest of this is pretty much just a rant. I've spent some time researching some of the major software options on the market and I'm genuinely impressed at the lack of some simple features and options that most of them have. I realize the commercial drone industry is still pretty young but there is so much potential just sitting there. I'm not a software engineer by any means but I have a decent understanding. The fact that I can't enter point coordinates to generate a location marker have multiple POIs per plan or manually align a map in DD after almost a decade is a bit astounding.,Have you had a look at Litchi?,"If it might pick your interest  Parrot sales 2 drones that could fit your application. The ANAFI AI and the ANAFI USA.  https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi-ai  The first one is meant for mapping the other has a thermal camera for ""military application "" .  Have a look see if the specs match your mission requirements.   Cheers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beta release of new free photogrammetry flight app,https://www.reddit.com/r/drones/comments/tgcl0z/beta_release_of_new_free_photogrammetry_flight_app/,We've previously posted an invite to a closed beta of a new free flight app for photogrammetry Mapware Fly.  Today we've opened the beta release to everyone and you can get it on the Google Play Store here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapware.fly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapware.fly)  A few notes on the app:  1. At this stage it's an app for Android tablets and works with DJI Mavic 2 Pro drones. 2. Although we have customers who will use this with our Mapware photogrammetry engine the images it captures can be used with any photogrammetry app.  We hope you'll try it and let us know what you think at [https://mapware.ai/contact-us/](https://mapware.ai/contact-us/).,Does this software support the Mavic Air 2 series of drones?  I would like to demo this in our Environmental Construction and Remediation division if possible.  I can see some applications where it would fit if it's possible to do volumetrics on stockpiled material for backfilling excavations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
